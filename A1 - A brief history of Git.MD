##The needs
In 1991, Linus Torvalds (LT) created the Linux kernel. Its versionning was done using basic archives stored on servers because LT didn't liked centralized source code manager systems.

This lasted until 2002 when the kernel was managed by [BitKeeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitKeeper) so LT's technical requirements were satisfied. Unfortunately, BitKeeper stopped supporting for free the project in 2005 because of some reverse engineering stories (Google that ;-)).

This is where the need of Git came from.

Its very first version came out in two months after LT started to work on it.

##Fun fact about Git
What does _git_ stand for ? Well if you haven't read Git README file yet, here's a sample :

```
The name "git" was given by Linus Torvalds when he wrote the very
first version. He described the tool as "the stupid content tracker"
and the name as (depending on your mood):

 - random three-letter combination that is pronounceable, and not
   actually used by any common UNIX command.  The fact that it is a
   mispronunciation of "get" may or may not be relevant.
 - stupid. contemptible and despicable. simple. Take your pick from the
   dictionary of slang.
 - "global information tracker": you're in a good mood, and it actually
   works for you. Angels sing, and a light suddenly fills the room.
 - "goddamn idiotic truckload of sh*t": when it breaks
 ```
